            Hello Nanao!
                <br>
                <br>
                I have been in love with your for the past 20+ months and every second passes by, it makes my love towards you more stronger.
                The journey we chose was a difficult one but being together down the line makes it easier, reliable and more that just easy.
                <br><br>
                As far as I can see, it is all blissful along with you. Without you, my life would look just as hopeless as counting the stars.
                <br><br>
                I know its not that attractive as I thought it would be but I tried to make it look good. I know you are innovative and have flawless ideas but this is my extent of creativity. I know its a bit of a disappointment but if this effort makes you smile even for 5 seconds, then it worth it all along.
                <br><br>
                I Love You 581!
