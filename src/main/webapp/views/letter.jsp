                Dear Nanao,<br><br>
                It has been a wonderful day! A special day for you! A day you want to be remembering!
                Laughing together, craving together, sleeping together, laying together, smiling together and
                most importantly caring together. This sums us the whole day as Remarkable! A day you don't wanna
                forget!<br><br>
                Since you were at a bad shape, this was only obvious for me to do something about it.
                So this was the idea I came across. Staring your morning with making you feel special and closing
                it with the same! Up till now, everything is going as planned. And now its time for the last
                thing, ending the day how it started.<br><br>
                Its good to see you smile. It adorable. I'll try to keep up with the pace
                and make sure it remains consistent.<br><br>Happy Neha Day!<br><br>I Love You.
