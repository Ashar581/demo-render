        Well, its not that it is the first time we are fighting. Neither its the first time we say
        "Today was extreme". The fun fact is the more we stay together the more "extreme" levels comes up
        as an addition.

    <br><br>
        Now yes, it is true that things are bad yet again but arent you already understanding the pattern?
        These things are bound to happen! These are a part of this whole process of togetherness. Some gives up
         and some just don't. Don't you think we are added to the "just don't" list?
    <br><br>
        Just to make it clear, I am not trying to make you feel special or win over you, all my efforts are for you to be stable
        enough to get hold of your sense of reasoning. You have had a major spell of anger frustration, now its
         time for cool heads. Even when you were going back, you still had that flair of fighting with me. Even asked
         me not to do anything and yet I am doing it, even after knowing someday you'll be disrespecting those efforts
         in anger (understand the point). After knowing every thing, I am still persistent on completing this new update since I know
         you are waiting for it. Even though you said, don't do anything.
    <br><br>
        This new update which I was working on for a while now is completed. Don't expect you to appreciate it,
        not today at least. Just smile instead and once you are done reading, let me know so that I can switch
        the server off.
    <br><br>
        Sorry baby. I'll change things from now on. I promise. Take care.
    <br><br>
        I Love You 581!
