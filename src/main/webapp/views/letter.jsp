                Dear Nanao,<br><br>
                This letter is for you to read. This letter comes with no other intentions
                but letting you know that even though I am in a mess, I still support you. 
                Even when I am at my lowest, I'll still support you. You did me dirty. Yes! True! 
                But I am still here for you. Even though I haven't forgiven you, I am still with you and will 
                try to keep up my pace in doing so.<br><br>
                These are little things we don't wanna give away. I have taken this time of updating 
                yours dedicated site with one intention, making you feel special.I do feel stupid 
                doing so. As for the eyes of normal people, I am doing the wrong this of still 
                supporting you. But! Yet I choose you. Still willing to risk it all. Being afraid 
                of the fact that you might as well forget these efforts of mine and still 
                disrespect me and put me in a state of abyss.<br><br>
                Knowing everything I am still stupid and still here for you.<br><br>I Love You.
