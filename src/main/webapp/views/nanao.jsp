                Nicknames, they carry no meaning but pure emotions. People
                usually give nicknames to someone they are attached to.<br><br>
                Nicknames are supposed to be rare and sweet. The meaning it holds
                it can only be understood by the nickname holder. That's the beauty
                of this word.<br><br>
                Originally the term Nanao came from, "My sweet little Nanao". Now,
                just saying Nanao would give you the feel and emotion of the whole phrase.<br><br>
                Just so that you know, there can only be one Nanao! and that word sums up the cuteness you carry
                and happiness you cannot measure.<br><br>
                I love you my sweet little Nanao!
