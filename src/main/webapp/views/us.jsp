                It is about to be 24 months aka 2 years. It has been really hard 
                for us time after time. Things have been worse and to be fair, it
                cannot for any worse from here.<br><br>However, we have chosen this path. 
                We chose to continue. So now it is up to us how we fix this mess.<br><br> 
                We have cried, laughed, begged, apologised and shared memories, all 
                together. That does have a meaning.<br><br>It means US.
